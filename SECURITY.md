## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a vulnerability or security issue in this project, **please do not open a public GitHub issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

### How to Report

To report a vulnerability, please contact us securely at:

üìß **Security Contact Email:** [EDMT security](mailto:francisodero10@gmail.com)


We aim to triage all reports within **2 business days**, and will keep you informed of progress until a resolution is reached.

### What Happens After You Report

Once we receive your report:

1. Our security team will triage and verify the issue.
2. If confirmed, we will:
   - Acknowledge the report publicly (with credit to you, if desired).
   - Work on a fix in coordination with you if needed.
   - Prepare a coordinated release including the fix.
3. After the fix is released, we may publish a full security advisory detailing the vulnerability.

If the issue does not meet our definition of a security vulnerability, we will explain why and suggest alternative approaches where applicable.

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated vulnerability disclosure** process to ensure that users are protected before details become public.

Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly until a fix has been released and a security advisory published, unless explicitly authorized by the project maintainers.

## Thank You

Your efforts in responsibly disclosing security issues help improve the overall security of the project and protect users worldwide.
